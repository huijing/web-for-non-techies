Let's talk about this thing called the **Internet**. Most people know *of* the internet. According to [Internet World Stats](http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm), as of November 2015, there are around 3.3 billion internet users in the world. That's about 40% of the world's population. So we can surmise that a lot of people *use* the internet as well. But what is it? Don't worry if you can't answer the question. Turns out, [millions of people who use Facebook](http://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/) don't know they are using the internet.

You may also have heard of something called the **World Wide Web**. Guess what? The Internet and the World Wide Web are *not* the same thing. But you, dear reader, will soon know the difference. Doesn't hurt to know some trivia, right? 

The internet is the entire network of networks that connect all the world's devices to each other. It is the infrastructure that provides a number of services for us to communicate information. The world wide web is one of those services. Examples of other services are things like email, instant messaging or file transfer, just to name a few.

The internet has become relatively accessible in this day and age, and it's easy to take connectivity for granted. But if you stop and think about it, the fact that it works at all, that someone can send an instant message from South Africa to London using their smart-phone during their commute, is really amazing. Just half a century ago, this was far from a reality.

Keep in mind that computers in this era were behemoths spanning entire rooms, and were very expensive. Instead of microchips, they ran on vacuum tubes, diodes and transistors. And each of these giant machines had their own proprietary operating systems, which made the sharing of resources and software very challenging.

Programs were only usable on the machines they were developed for, and if you wanted a copy on the machine your organisation used, good luck duplicating what you just seen on those other guys' machine. Simplifying this process was one of the motivating factors behind the development of computer networking.

## A brief history of the internet and its pioneers

If we go back to the beginning, we'll find that the internet had its roots in the military. Many technological advances were driven by military needs, and later evolved to have non-military uses. The internet is one of them. The 20th century was pretty tumultuous, somehow one World War wasn't enough, so we had another one. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was [set up in 1958](http://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/where-the-future-becomes-now) by the United States government in response to the Soviets launching Sputnik 1. Basically, it was part of a military technology arms race. 

**The TL:DR version of things is, the best and brightest minds were brought in to work for the U.S. military. And they came up with a way for computers to share information more easily.**

But let's give some kudos to these smart people and find out a bit more about them. Without these Internet Pioneers, you wouldn't be reading this book (because it's online only <span class="o-emoji" role="img" tabindex="0" aria-label="person shrugging">ü§∑‚Äç</span>). There is an excellent book by [Katie Hafner](http://katiehafner.com/books/where-wizards-stay-up-late/) titled *[Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet](http://www.amazon.com/Where-Wizards-Stay-Up-Late/dp/0684832674)*, which I highly recommend you read.

### Pioneering women of the internet

Google the term ‚Äúinternet pioneers‚Äù and you find there is no shortage of information on men like J.C.R. Licklider, Claude Shannon, Robert Taylor, Lawrence Roberts, Paul Baran, Donald Davis, Wes Clark, Frank Heart, Vint Cerf, Robert Kahn (as you can see the list is long) and so on. All of these men are covered in the book I mentioned earlier, and their contributions to the internet have been documented in the record books for years to come.

But there are a number of notable contributions from women as well, which may not be as widely known. And so we shall highlight some of them here. There are many more women whose contributions go unrecognised, and my hope is that eventually they will come to light.

**Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler**, widely known as Hedy Lamarr, was an Austrian and American actress and inventor. During World War II, she came up with the idea of frequency hopping to prevent enemies from jamming the radio signals that controlled torpedoes, and was granted a patent on August 11, 1942. In spite of her technological acumen, she was more known for her beauty than her brains, and her story is a sad reminder of our society which still measures a woman's worth by her looks. [A documentary](https://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/bombshell-the-hedy-lamarr-story-2017) about her was released in April 2017.

## Devices, cables and radio waves

After that history lesson, let's bring it back to the original question, what exactly is the internet? Well, the internet is the entire network of networks that connect all the world's devices to each other. It is made up of various copper cables, fibre-optic cables and wireless networks all across the planet. The internet was built to transfer information, digital information to be exact. 

Every computer's inner workings consist of a plethora of microchips which contain thousands of electric micro-circuits. These circuits only have two states, on or off, AKA 1 or 0, respectively. These two numbers are binary digits, or bits for short. Sequences of such bits in different combinations can be used to represent all kinds of information, digitally.

<figure class="u-float-right">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/1/utility-pole.jpeg" srcset="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/1/utility-pole@2x.jpeg 2x" alt="Utility pole"/>
    <figcaption><small><em>The utility pole outside my house</em></small></figcaption>
</figure>

There is a phrase used in telecommunications called ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù or ‚Äúlast kilometre‚Äù which refers to the part of the telecommunications network that is responsible for delivery to the end-user, like you and me. For example, those cables up on the utility poles along roads, or cell towers that broadcast to your mobile phones. For wired telecommunications, copper cables are commonly for the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù infrastructure.

You know those ethernet cables connected to your computer? Those are copper cables, twisted copper cables. Copper is used because it has the highest electrical conductivity of all non-precious metals. Your bits of data are transmitted across these copper cables as electrical pulses, but copper cabling is susceptible to electromagnetic interference from other cables and power wires. In fact, the maximum viable length of a single ethernet cable is around 100 metres. Cable internet gets its name from the fact that it transmits data over the same cables that transmit cable television.

Many countries are investing in ‚ÄúFibre to the *x*‚Äù (FTTX) infrastructure. *X* in this case can refer to *H* for home, *B* for business and so on. Fibre-optic cables are made of glass, engineered to reflect light signals across very long distances without much degradation. And they can carry a lot more data than copper cables. The downside, at least for now, is that fibre-optic components are expensive, because the manufacturing process is pretty labour-intensive. There is an observable transition from copper to fibre though, as demand for high-speed internet continues to grow exponentially.

All the global submarine internet cables are fibre-optic cables. It is the only viable option for transmitting data across continents along the ocean floor reliably. You may be surprised (or not) to find that the locations of these cables are pretty easy to pin-point. Some of them are even out in the open, laying on some beach along various coasts around the world. But these cables are what allow a Skype call from Singapore to Argentina, or a text from San Francisco to Malaysia.

## Who takes care of the internet?

The internet in its entirety is not owned by anyone. Part of the physical infrastructure are owned by many different corporations, governments, schools, organisations, even private citizens. Given the disparate nature of ownership, there are several organisations in charge of internet-related standards, and pushing to improve the internet for everyone. The key organisation is the [Internet Society (ISOC)](http://www.internetsociety.org/), an international, non-profit, membership organisation that fosters the expansion of the Internet by providing financial and legal support for the following groups:

- [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://www.ietf.org/)
- [Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)](https://www.ietf.org/iesg/)
- [Internet Architecture Board (IAB)](https://www.iab.org/)
- [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](http://www.iana.org/)    
- [RFC Editor](https://www.rfc-editor.org/)
- [IETF Secretariat](https://www.ietf.org/secretariat.html)
- [IETF Trust](http://trustee.ietf.org/)
