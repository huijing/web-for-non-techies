HTTP
explains how files are formatted and transmitted between the server and the browser. HTTP is considered as a stateless protocol due to the process of independent execution of its command without any knowledge about it prior. 
HTTP was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and World Wide Consortium back in 1999 leading in the publication of a series of Requests for Comments (RFCs) with its first version as HTTP/1.1 prior to the HTTP/0.9 which is a one-line protocol to bootstrap the web in an informational standard.
